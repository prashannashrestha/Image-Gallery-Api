# ImageGalleryDrive

**ImageGalleryDrive** is a web application that centralizes images from multiple Google Drive accounts into a single, easy-to-use image gallery. It leverages the Google Drive API to fetch images from user-specified folders and organizes them into albums. The gallery allows users to browse images, search for albums, and display them in an organized and visually appealing way.

## How it Works

1. **Google Drive Integration**: 
   - The app uses the **Google Drive API** to fetch images from specified Google Drive folders.
   - Folder IDs are provided by the user, and the images are fetched via a secure backend that hides the API key.

2. **Customizable Folder IDs and Album Groups**:
   - Users can modify the `folderIds` and `albumGroups` configurations to specify their own Google Drive folder IDs and the organization of albums.
   - The app allows flexible album grouping (e.g., by device, theme, event, etc.).

3. **Image Display**:
   - The gallery displays images in a glass-like UI with hover effects and smooth transitions.
   - Clicking on an image opens it in a full-screen modal view.
